/workspaces/bts_jewel/downloads/ - landing of zip files from kaggle.
/workspaces/bts_jewel/data/ - where raw data are stored.
/workspaces/bts_jewel/final/ - where final data is stored

bts_trends.ipynb - jupyter notebook used to get data from Google Trends
world_pop.ipynb - jupyter notbeook used to get data from Kaggle
analysis.ipynb - jupyter notebook used to analyze and clean data

Here are the steps/solutions that I've used for the assessment.
First I extract the World Population Data and BTS interest per region using bts_trends.ipynb and world_pop.ipynb. Then I used the analysis.ipynb to clean and analyze the data.

1. Check the most populated Country to satisfy the sizeable population
2. After getting the populated Country filter the Median age of 18 to 25 
3. Final consideration is to get the highest BTS interest out of the first 2 consideration.
4. So the List of country are: Mayotte, French Guiana, Pakistan, Guatemala, Honduras, Nepal
